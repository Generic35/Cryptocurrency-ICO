### A real world initial coin offering (ICO) including: 

#### Crowdsale
- Crowdsale: Investors send Ether to the contract which computes the amount of tokens the investor should get in return based on the a configured rate of tokens per ETH.
- Timed Crowsale: The Crowdsale has an opening time and a closing time
- Capped Crowsale: The Crowdsale has a maximuma amount of funds that can be raised in the crowdsale
- Minted Crowdsale: The token is mintable, meaning each time a token is purchased the smart contract mints a token, instead of having a set total supply.
- White Listed Crowdsale: This is a real world ICO, it includes know your customer (KYC) to match contributions to real people
- Refundable Crowdsale: The ICO will have a minimum funding goal, if the funding goal is not met, all of the funds sold in the public rounds are refunded from the vault they are stored in. Investors can therefor claim a refund for their investment.

#### Presale vs. Public Sale
- Presale vs. Public Sale: The contributor gets more tokens for the same amount of Ether during the presale than the public sale. During presale the funds go to the wallet of the contract owner rather than the refund vault.

#### Token Distribution & Vesting
- Token Distribution & Vesting: An example of Token distribution can be represented on a dougnut chart where a certain percentage goes to the founders, another percentage to the company and another to the public.
